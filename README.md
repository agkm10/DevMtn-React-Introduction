# DevMtn-React-Introduction

## Setup
For this setup we will be using `create-react-app` to quickly create a `react` project. To get started `npm install` or `yarn install` when in the root directory of the project. Be sure to also `sudo npm install -g create-react-app` to gain access to its CLI. Once everything is installed we're ready to create the project. 

In your terminal type in `create-react-app app` when in the root directory of the project.
